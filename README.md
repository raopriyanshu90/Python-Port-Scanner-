# 🔍 Python Port Scanner

A simple and fast **multi-threaded TCP Port Scanner** built using Python's `socket` and `threading` modules.  
This tool scans a range of ports on a target machine to identify **open TCP ports**, similar to the basic behavior of tools like Nmap.

## 🚀 Features

- Multi-threaded port scanning (fast)
- TCP connect scanning using `socket.connect_ex()`
- Command-line interface
- Auto time measurement
- Lightweight & beginner-friendly
- Great for learning cybersecurity fundamentals

## 🧠 How It Works

The scanner attempts to connect to each port in the specified range.  
If the connection is successful → the port is **OPEN**.

It uses:
- `socket` for network connections  
- `threading` for fast parallel scanning  
- `sys.argv` for command-line arguments  
- `time` to track how long the scan took

## 📌 Usage

Run the script from terminal or CMD:

```bash
python port_scan.py TARGET START_PORT END_PORT
